#### Software
- A software is a collection of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.

#### Types of software:
- System Software
	- Ex. Device drivers, Operating Systems, Servers, Utilities, etc.
- Programming Software
	- Ex. Compilers, Debuggers, Interpreters, etc. 
- Application Software
	- Ex. Web apps, Mobile app, Desktop apps, etc.


#### Software Testing:
- Software testing is a part of software development process.
- Software testing is an activity to detect and identify defects in the software.
- The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client.

#### Software Quality:
- Bug-free
- Delivered on time
- Within the budget
- Meets the requirements and/or expectations
- Maintainable

#### Project vs Product
- If a software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirements then it is called Project.
- If a software application is developed for multiple customers based on the market requirements then it is called a Product.


#### Error, Bug, Failure
- Error - human mistake usually by the developer while writing or developing on the program
- Bug/Defect - when testing the program if the functionality is within the customer requirements or not. Usually found by the testers.
- Failure - when using the program by the customers and it cause a bug or an error in product or in real environment


#### Why the software has bugs
- Miscommunication or no communication
	- software requirements should be clear and communication is important
- Software Complexity
- Programming Errors
	- errors that developers make
- Changing requirements
	- changes made to the application
- Lack of skilled testers
	- lack of proper skill set
