# Test Cycle Closure
- here, the testing team will stop testing.

###### Activities
- evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test Coverage, Cost, Software, Critical Business Objectives, Quality.
- prepare test metrics based on the above parameters.
- document the learning out of the project.
- prepare test summary report.
- qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer.
- test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity. 


###### Deliverables
- Test closure reports
- Test metrics

# QA/Testing Activites
- understanding the requirements and specifications of the applications.
- identifying required Test Scenarios.
- designing test cases to validate application.
- setting up test environment (test bed).
- execute test cases to valid application.
- log test results (how many test cases passed/failed).
- defect reporting and tracking.
- retest fixed defects of previous build.
- perform various types of testing in application.
- reports to test lead about the status of assigned tasks.
- participated in regular team meetings.
- creating automation scripts.
- provides recommendation on whether or not the application/system is ready for production.



# 7 Principles of Software Testing

1.  Start software testing at early stages. Means from the beginning when you get the requirements.
2. Test the software in order to find defects.
3. Highly impossible to give the bug free software to the customer.
4. Should not do Exhaustive testing. Means we should not use same type of data for testing every time.
5. Testing is context-based. Means decide what types of testing should be conducted based on type of application.
6. We should follow the concept of Pesticide Paradox. Means, if you are executing same cases for longer run, they won't be find any defects. We have to keep update test cases in every cycle/release in order to find more defects.
7. We should follow defect clustering. Means some modules contains most of the defects. By experience, we can identify such risky modules. 80% of the problems are found in 20% of the modules.
