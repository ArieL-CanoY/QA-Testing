| What     | Smoke testing exercises the entire system from end to end                                                            | Sanity testing exercises only the particular component of the entire system                                            |     |
| When     | Smoke Testing is performed to make sure that critical functionalities of the application are working fine            | Sanity Testing is performed to check that new functionalities /bugs have been fixed                                    |     |
| Why      | The objective of the testing is to verify the stability of the system in order to proceed with more rigorous testing | The objective of the testing is to verify the rationality of the system in order to proceed with more rigorous testing |     |
| Scripted | Smoke testing is usually documented and scripted                                                                     | Sanity testing is not documented and unscripted                                                                        |     |
