### Blackbox testing
	- testing the application without prior knowledge about internal workings

	- usually company list all the smoke testing scenario or functionality to be test

### Regression testing
	- combination of sanity and smoke testing wherein it needs to test the core functionality thoroughly without affecting the other functionality of the system/application

### Retesting 
	- testing the application that has a defect/bug before to make sure that it working properly and the bug has been fixed

### Integration testing
