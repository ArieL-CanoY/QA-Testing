# No Auth
```python
- Postman wont send authorization details with a request unless you specify an auth type. @Postman
```


# Basic Auth
```python
>> Basic Auth
	- sending username and password with each request. The credentials are in plaintext or encoded using Base64 that is easily reversible.

url: https://postman-echo.com/basic-auth
username: postman
password: pasword

header content in the first request that will received a 401 response:
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Users"

format in header:
Authorization: Basic <credentials_here(username:password) - plaintext or base64 encoded>
```


# Digest Auth
```python
	- With Digest auth, the client sends a first request to the API, and the server responds with a few details, including a number that can be used only once (a _nonce_), a realm value, and a `401` unauthorized response. You then send back an encrypted array of data including a username and password combined with the data received from the server in the first request. The server uses the passed data to generate an encrypted string and compares it against what you sent to authenticate your request. @Postman
	- just like Basic Auth but more secured by hashing and encrypting the value of username and password when sending over the network.

url: https://postman-echo.com/digest-auth
username: postman
password: pasword


header content when sending the first request that will got 401 HTTP response status code:
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Users", nonce="gz2Ncqz5AEv4IkgePYzN5VKp8lnl80CZ", qop="auth"

# Bearer Token
```python
	- Bearer tokens enable requests to authenticate using an access key, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT). The token is a text string, included in the request header. 
	- just like token in Github - ghp_klasdf89a98asas9df0
	- Once a bearer token is issued, the token itself serves as proof of authentication. The server trusts that the holder of the token is the legitimate user.
	- Bearer tokens are often designed to be short-lived for security reasons. They may have an expiration time, after which a new token must be issued.
	- generated by the server in response to valid login request
	- a form of 

Format in header:
	Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>


```



# API Key
```python
	- With API key auth, you send a key-value pair to the API either in the request headers or query parameters.
