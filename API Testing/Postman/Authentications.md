```python
>> Basic Auth
	- sending username and password with each request. The credentials are encoded using Base64 and not secured.

username: postman
password: pasword



>> Digest Auth
	- just like Basic Auth but more secured by hashing and encrypting the value of username and password when sending over the network.

username: postman
password: pasword


>> Bearer Token
	- just like token in Github - ghp_klasdf89a98asas9df0
